                  <p>Hey all!</p>
                  <p>
                    I’ve been meaning to start a new webcomic ever since I
                    finished <a href="http://fruitjacket.com/">Fruit Jacket</a>.
                    Lots of things have changed since, I have 4&nbsp;

                    </a>
                    out, &nbsp;but I still love webcomics and I’m excited to
                    finally be doing this again!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Home Queer Home will be following three friends who live in
                    Athens. I’m planning short, fun, standalone slice-of-life
                    episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for checking the comic out! Maybe stick around for
                    more? I’ll be posting a new page every Wednesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A special hi and thank you for being here if you saw me on
                    Thought Bubble and decided to check out my new comic! 🙂
                    I’ll be there this weekend, so I’m writing this from the
                    past, but I wanted to say something anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone else: Hi and thank you for being here too,
                    especially to everyone who has supported me and encouraged
                    me to keep working on this comic, and comics in general
                    &lt;3
                    <br />
                    Also, holy crap, I’m going to
                    <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">
                      Thought Bubble
                    </a>
                    ! 😮
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now I’m going to pack my suitcase and actually travel to go
                    to said festival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for reading this, everyone! I’ll be fixing the site
                    more when I get back. For now, pardon the empty space and
                    closed boxes, I just moved here and I have a plane to catch.

                    I got to meet artists and creators I admire, saw some
                    amazingly beautiful indie comics and I&nbsp;came back
                    inspired to make more! I’ll be showing you some stuff I

                    so inspiring and I want to take my time to give them all the

                    I really do have a refreshed perspective when it comes to my
                    electronics when I’m away from home for a bit. Come up with
                    all these things I could do differently. What about you?

                    You know how some comics use angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) for
                    dialogue that isn’t English but you’re reading it in English
                    anyway? Well, in this one the characters are speaking Greek
                    all the time. So this &lt;text&gt; is dialogue that’s spoken
                    in English while the simple text is supposed to be Greek. I
                    don’t know if this fact is as entertaining to you as it is
                    to me, but I thought I’d share it!

                    When I was doing Fruit Jacket, I kept forgetting to draw the
                    chairs that people were sitting on. I hadn’t considered that
                    people carry bags with them yet, though, so now that I have,
                    my new issue is forgetting the bags/backpacks in half of the
                    panels. Yes I can go back and correct them, but I’d rather
                    post it on time. I’m really following the “done not perfect”
                    thing with this comic, because I’d rather keep doing it with
                    small details missing than fall behind and get discouraged.
                    Maybe eventually I’ll get the hang of it and stop forgetting
                    things! #goals

                    If I were to make a Patreon for this comic, what would you
                    like to see as rewards? A sketchblog, seeing the behind the
                    scenes of Home Queer Home, a free issue of OMG Lesbians by
                    post or email? Something completely different?

                    Making this comic is taking up a lot of time, and I really
                    want to continue making it. But life, food, etc. So I’m
                    trying to come up with ways that it could be supported. Any
                    ideas on rewards are welcome, no matter how obvious you
                    might think yours is, let me know what you’d like to see!

                    New episode starting today! It’s going to be a shorter one.

                    I’m back from Thessaloniki, where I tabled a small festival,
                    got a better idea of the city by walking a lot, and
                    discovered / fell in love with paprika sauce in gyro.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being in festivals is always inspiring in some way. My head
                    is full and I keep thinking of art projects I want to work
                    on. Thanks to everyone who came and hang out, I hope to see
                    you again soon! 🙂

                    10th page today! A little late, but still here on a
                    Wednesday!

                    Started listening to Christmas music. I almost made the
                    second episode a Christmas special, but I thought it would
                    be a little weird to have the seasons change so suddenly!
                    I’d definitely like to make one at some point, not sure if
                    it will happen this year.

                    Still working on Patreon reward levels. I’m thinking of
                    making a kind of regular autobio comic strip if people like
                    the idea enough to support it!

                    This took so long! I’ve been thinking I’m putting too much
                    work on myself for each page. (Who does 10 panels – and
                    why?!) But in the end I’m happy with how it came out!

                    Pen pressure stopped working when I had to do the shading
                    again.

                    Life is full of adventures! I missed drawing these cuties!
                    Sorry for the skipped updates lately. Maybe when I grow up
                    I’ll have a buffer and you’ll still get a comic when
                    unexpected things happen. Working on it.

                    You might have noticed I’ve been slower and slower with
                    updates lately. I’d blame the summer, but it clearly hasn’t
                    arrived in Athens yet. No, this specific page was delayed
                    because of multiple reasons, including being unhappy with
                    how it looked like at first and my generally messy
                    non-schedule as the “school year” ends. I’m not happy about
                    that, this is meant to be a weekly webcomic. But on the
                    other hand I didn’t mean for it to have a new update on
                    literally every Wednesday of the year, without mercy /
                    holidays for me. So, this being the last week of June and
                    the last page of this episode, I’m calling it an end of
                    Season 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’m not planning on quitting the comic for now. The time off
                    from updates will give me space to work on the Season 2 in a
                    way that I simply can’t, while updates are running. There
                    might be changes starting this fall, but my goal is to keep
                    the weekly updates and make the comic better. We’ll see what
                    that means!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, I’ll be pausing my Patreon so there will be no
                    charges while the comic is on holidays. And I’ll still be
                    active on other places – probably mostly on Instagram!
                  </p>
                  <p>Enjoy the summer(?) and thank you so much for reading!</p>
                  <p>See you soon</p>

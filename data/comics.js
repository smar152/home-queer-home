                  <p>Hey all!</p>
                  <p>
                    I‚Äôve been meaning to start a new webcomic ever since I
                    finished <a href="http://fruitjacket.com/">Fruit Jacket</a>.
                    Lots of things have changed since, I have 4&nbsp;

                    </a>
                    out, &nbsp;but I still love webcomics and I‚Äôm excited to
                    finally be doing this again!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Home Queer Home will be following three friends who live in
                    Athens. I‚Äôm planning short, fun, standalone slice-of-life
                    episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for checking the comic out! Maybe stick around for
                    more? I‚Äôll be posting a new page every Wednesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A special hi and thank you for being here if you saw me on
                    Thought Bubble and decided to check out my new comic! üôÇ
                    I‚Äôll be there this weekend, so I‚Äôm writing this from the
                    past, but I wanted to say something anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone else: Hi and thank you for being here too,
                    especially to everyone who has supported me and encouraged
                    me to keep working on this comic, and comics in general
                    &lt;3
                    <br />
                    Also, holy crap, I‚Äôm going to
                    <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">
                      Thought Bubble

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now I‚Äôm going to pack my suitcase and actually travel to go
                    to said festival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for reading this, everyone! I‚Äôll be fixing the site
                    more when I get back. For now, pardon the empty space and
                    closed boxes, I just moved here and I have a plane to catch.

                  I got to meet artists and creators I admire, saw some
                  amazingly beautiful indie comics and I&nbsp;came back inspired
                  to make more! I‚Äôll be showing you some stuff I discovered on

                    I really do have a refreshed perspective when it comes to my
                    electronics when I‚Äôm away from home for a bit. Come up with

                    You know how some comics use angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) for
                    dialogue that isn‚Äôt English but you‚Äôre reading it in English
                    anyway? Well, in this one the characters are speaking Greek
                    all the time. So this &lt;text&gt; is dialogue that‚Äôs spoken
                    in English while the simple text is supposed to be Greek. I
                    don‚Äôt know if this fact is as entertaining to you as it is
                    to me, but I thought I‚Äôd share it!

                    When I was doing Fruit Jacket, I kept forgetting to draw the
                    chairs that people were sitting on. I hadn‚Äôt considered that
                    people carry bags with them yet, though, so now that I have,
                    my new issue is forgetting the bags/backpacks in half of the
                    panels. Yes I can go back and correct them, but I‚Äôd rather
                    post it on time. I‚Äôm really following the ‚Äúdone not perfect‚Äù
                    thing with this comic, because I‚Äôd rather keep doing it with
                    small details missing than fall behind and get discouraged.
                    Maybe eventually I‚Äôll get the hang of it and stop forgetting
                    things! #goals

                    If I were to make a Patreon for this comic, what would you
                    like to see as rewards? A sketchblog, seeing the behind the
                    scenes of Home Queer Home, a free issue of OMG Lesbians by

                    New episode starting today! It‚Äôs going to be a shorter one.

                    I‚Äôm back from Thessaloniki, where I tabled a small festival,
                    got a better idea of the city by walking a lot, and
                    discovered / fell in love with paprika sauce in gyro.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being in festivals is always inspiring in some way. My head
                    is full and I keep thinking of art projects I want to work
                    on. Thanks to everyone who came and hang out, I hope to see
                    you again soon! üôÇ

                    Started listening to Christmas music. I almost made the
                    second episode a Christmas special, but I thought it would
                    be a little weird to have the seasons change so suddenly!
                    I‚Äôd definitely like to make one at some point, not sure if
                    it will happen this year.

                    the idea enough to support it!

                    You might have noticed I‚Äôve been slower and slower with
                    updates lately. I‚Äôd blame the summer, but it clearly hasn‚Äôt
                    arrived in Athens yet. No, this specific page was delayed
                    because of multiple reasons, including being unhappy with
                    how it looked like at first and my generally messy
                    non-schedule as the ‚Äúschool year‚Äù ends. I‚Äôm not happy about
                    that, this is meant to be a weekly webcomic. But on the
                    other hand I didn‚Äôt mean for it to have a new update on
                    literally every Wednesday of the year, without mercy /
                    holidays for me. So, this being the last week of June and
                    the last page of this episode, I‚Äôm calling it an end of
                    Season 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I‚Äôm not planning on quitting the comic for now. The time off
                    from updates will give me space to work on the Season 2 in a
                    way that I simply can‚Äôt, while updates are running. There
                    might be changes starting this fall, but my goal is to keep
                    the weekly updates and make the comic better. We‚Äôll see what
                    that means!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, I‚Äôll be pausing my Patreon so there will be no
                    charges while the comic is on holidays. And I‚Äôll still be
                    active on other places ‚Äì probably mostly on Instagram!
                  </p>
                  <p>Enjoy the summer(?) and thank you so much for reading!</p>
                  <p>See you soon</p>

            <p>Yay, Season 2 starts today!<br>
            (You can totally start from here even if you haven‚Äôt read a single page so far.)</p>
            <p>It feels like a new start. As you can see we have a different page format in this season, hopefully the art and writing are better, and there are no episode divisions.</p>
            <p>I‚Äôm glad I took a break from weekly deadlines. It did give me some perspective and time to work on this season in advance (no, I have no idea how to take actual breaks). I‚Äôve outlined 40 strips and I‚Äôm so excited to start sharing them with you! </p>
            <p>Remember to follow me on mostly instagram but other places too, where I share updates, sketches, other art and stuff related or not to this specific comic.</p>

            <p>Other news:<strong> I‚Äôve started making daily diary comics!</strong><br>
            Reading other people‚Äôs autobio comics has always been inspiring for me and I just decided to start on a random day and see how it goes. Well, it‚Äôs been a week and a day and I‚Äôm still very much into it! Not making the greatest art ‚Äì actually I‚Äôm doing the simplest sketches, so it can be sustainable. But it relaxes me more than I thought it would and leaves me in the mood to make more art. I hope you‚Äôll like them too!<br>

            <p>Speaking of more comics, I‚Äôve started making autobio ones, daily! I‚Äôll be posting one per week on social media and all 5 of them on Patreon every week.

            <div><p>So in this page I have finally done what everyone keeps asking me when they hear I‚Äôm a computer science student and I make comics: ‚Äúmaybe you could combine the two?‚Äù</p>
            <p>It‚Äôs December, which means you might be looking for gift ideas, and I think <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/smarmakescomics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">funny comics about lesbians</a> could make some of your friends happy. Take a look at my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/smarmakescomics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Etsy shop</a>? All my comics are also available as pdfs ‚Äì I recently finally made the 3rd issue of OMG Lesbians available! Check them all out <a href="https://gumroad.com/smar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I really hope to make another update this week to catch up, we‚Äôll see how that goes! Check back on Friday.</p>

I meant to be a good self boss and give myself <del>time to work on other projects</del>&nbsp;actual holidays from this comic, for 2 weeks so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/262838724390503/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Come say hi tomorrow</a> if you‚Äôre in Athens, otherwise see you next year!&nbsp;I‚Äôll still be around social media and doing (almost) daily autobio comics (new post is almost posted on Patreon). I‚Äôm working on the December rewards too, which actually helped me get the OMG Lesbians #4 translation going! Stay tuned for that too.</p>
            <p>Thankfully Patreon supporters (like the one you see pictured on Panel 1) want to see themselves in the comic, otherwise I‚Äôd forget that people who are not the protagonists or their friends / love interests exist in this Athens place!

<p>Still in holiday spirit since I was 2 updates behind, and I actually made a change* and now we‚Äôre 3 updates behind! See you next Wednesday for the last strip of 2018 :‚ÄôD</p>
<p>See the back of the same <a href="https://www.patreon.com/smar">Patreon</a> supporter we met 2 strips ago. He‚Äôs friends with Gina apparently!</p>
<p>(* Someone had planned a strip with 9 panels. Why! So I broke it up in 2 strips to make it more reasonable.)</p>

            <p>So this was supposed to be the last page of 2018. Not quite caught up yet, but at least we‚Äôre done with last year‚Äôs pages!</p>
<p>I tried a new thing with the inking but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be keeping it up. It made coloring more complicated and don‚Äôt really think it added much to the comic.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm so glad I can finally share it. Being accepted to make a comic for their birthday issue was my first success of the year. I made a quite personal comic essay, not the easiest thing, and I‚Äôm so happy/sorry to see people relate to it!</p>

                  <p>Hey all!</p>
                  <p>
                    I‚Äôve been meaning to start a new webcomic ever since I
                    finished <a href="http://fruitjacket.com/">Fruit Jacket</a>.
                    Lots of things have changed since, I have 4&nbsp;

                    </a>
                    out, &nbsp;but I still love webcomics and I‚Äôm excited to
                    finally be doing this again!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Home Queer Home will be following three friends who live in
                    Athens. I‚Äôm planning short, fun, standalone slice-of-life
                    episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for checking the comic out! Maybe stick around for
                    more? I‚Äôll be posting a new page every Wednesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A special hi and thank you for being here if you saw me on
                    Thought Bubble and decided to check out my new comic! üôÇ
                    I‚Äôll be there this weekend, so I‚Äôm writing this from the
                    past, but I wanted to say something anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone else: Hi and thank you for being here too,
                    especially to everyone who has supported me and encouraged
                    me to keep working on this comic, and comics in general
                    &lt;3
                    <br />
                    Also, holy crap, I‚Äôm going to
                    <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now I‚Äôm going to pack my suitcase and actually travel to go
                    to said festival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks for reading this, everyone! I‚Äôll be fixing the site
                    more when I get back. For now, pardon the empty space and
                    closed boxes, I just moved here and I have a plane to catch.

                    I got to meet artists and creators I admire, saw some
                    amazingly beautiful indie comics and I&nbsp;came back
                    inspired to make more! I‚Äôll be showing you some stuff I
                    discovered on Fridays, when I post One Thing I Like on

                    I really do have a refreshed perspective when it comes to my
                    electronics when I‚Äôm away from home for a bit. Come up with
                    all these things I could do differently. What about you?

                    You know how some comics use angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) for
                    dialogue that isn‚Äôt English but you‚Äôre reading it in English
                    anyway? Well, in this one the characters are speaking Greek
                    all the time. So this &lt;text&gt; is dialogue that‚Äôs spoken
                    in English while the simple text is supposed to be Greek. I
                    don‚Äôt know if this fact is as entertaining to you as it is
                    to me, but I thought I‚Äôd share it!

                    When I was doing Fruit Jacket, I kept forgetting to draw the
                    chairs that people were sitting on. I hadn‚Äôt considered that
                    people carry bags with them yet, though, so now that I have,
                    my new issue is forgetting the bags/backpacks in half of the
                    panels. Yes I can go back and correct them, but I‚Äôd rather
                    post it on time. I‚Äôm really following the ‚Äúdone not perfect‚Äù
                    thing with this comic, because I‚Äôd rather keep doing it with
                    small details missing than fall behind and get discouraged.
                    Maybe eventually I‚Äôll get the hang of it and stop forgetting
                    things! #goals

                    If I were to make a Patreon for this comic, what would you
                    like to see as rewards? A sketchblog, seeing the behind the
                    scenes of Home Queer Home, a free issue of OMG Lesbians by
                    post or email? Something completely different?

                    Making this comic is taking up a lot of time, and I really

                    trying to come up with ways that it could be supported. Any

                    New episode starting today! It‚Äôs going to be a shorter one.

                    I‚Äôm back from Thessaloniki, where I tabled a small festival,
                    got a better idea of the city by walking a lot, and
                    discovered / fell in love with paprika sauce in gyro.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being in festivals is always inspiring in some way. My head
                    is full and I keep thinking of art projects I want to work
                    on. Thanks to everyone who came and hang out, I hope to see
                    you again soon! üôÇ

                    Started listening to Christmas music. I almost made the
                    second episode a Christmas special, but I thought it would
                    be a little weird to have the seasons change so suddenly!
                    I‚Äôd definitely like to make one at some point, not sure if
                    it will happen this year.

                    the idea enough to support it!

                    I shaded this without pen pressure because I‚Äôm in a rush and
                    my tablet isn‚Äôt collaborating.

                    Pen pressure stopped working when I had to do the shading

                    Life is full of adventures! I missed drawing these cuties!
                    Sorry for the skipped updates lately. Maybe when I grow up
                    I‚Äôll have a buffer and you‚Äôll still get a comic when
                    unexpected things happen. Working on it.

                    You might have noticed I‚Äôve been slower and slower with
                    updates lately. I‚Äôd blame the summer, but it clearly hasn‚Äôt
                    arrived in Athens yet. No, this specific page was delayed
                    because of multiple reasons, including being unhappy with
                    how it looked like at first and my generally messy
                    non-schedule as the ‚Äúschool year‚Äù ends. I‚Äôm not happy about
                    that, this is meant to be a weekly webcomic. But on the
                    other hand I didn‚Äôt mean for it to have a new update on
                    literally every Wednesday of the year, without mercy /
                    holidays for me. So, this being the last week of June and
                    the last page of this episode, I‚Äôm calling it an end of
                    Season 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I‚Äôm not planning on quitting the comic for now. The time off
                    from updates will give me space to work on the Season 2 in a
                    way that I simply can‚Äôt, while updates are running. There
                    might be changes starting this fall, but my goal is to keep
                    the weekly updates and make the comic better. We‚Äôll see what
                    that means!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, I‚Äôll be pausing my Patreon so there will be no
                    charges while the comic is on holidays. And I‚Äôll still be
                    active on other places ‚Äì probably mostly on Instagram!
                  </p>
                  <p>Enjoy the summer(?) and thank you so much for reading!</p>
                  <p>See you soon</p>
